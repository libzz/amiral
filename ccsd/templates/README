This directory contains templates for the CRCnet Configuration System.

Template files to be processed by the system must end in .tmpl.

These templates are only intended as examples.

The templates use the Cheetah template engine from
http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/

Further syntax documentation will be forthcoming eventually, but it's pretty
simple. It's basically Python syntax but stick a $ infront of every variable
name. Python control structures are available (for, while, etc).

Templates to be processed by the configuration system must implement a class
defined in the configuration daemon that is derived from the ccs_template
base class. Currently there are two classes that fulfil this criteria.

ccs_host        - Use for templates that relate to an individual host
ccs_network     - Use for templates that relate to many hosts, or the whole
                  network

You are welcome to create additional classes and load them as modules to
implement further types of template if you desire.
