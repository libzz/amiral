Assets and asset locations in the CRCnet configuration system
-------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware in the CRCnet system is tracked by assigning it an asset number. In
general each peice of hardware relates to a single asset number. Assets have
subassets which are components of the asset that perform a particular function,
generally a subasset is inseperable from the actual asset (or the asset would
not function without the subasset). Each asset has a set of default properties
(asset #, description, serialno, currency, price, date purchased, supplier)
which are used to store basic asset data. These properties are required in the
database, but the interface will allow them to default to "empty" values. 

Assets and Subassets in the configuration system are grouped by type. An asset
type defines which subassets may be present for assets that are instances of
that type while a subasset type defines the properties that may be present for
subassets that are instances of that type. Subassets and properties may be 
specified as required or optional via this type system. 

For example, an asset entry related to a soekris biscuit pc uses the following
concepts described above:

    Property:       Mac Address
    Property:       RAM
    Property:       Hard Drive Size

    Subasset Type:  Motherboard
                    * Has properties
                      - RAM (MB) (Required)
                      - Hard Drive Size (MB) (Required)

    Subasset Type:  Ethernet Interface
                    * Has properties
                      - MAC Address (required)

    Asset Type:     Soekris net4521
                    * Has subassets
                      - Motherboard (required)
                      - Ethernet Interface (eth0) (required)
                      - Ethernet Interface (eth1) (required)

    Asset:          Of type "Soekris net4521" has following data
                    - Asset #
                    - Description
                    - Serial No
                    - Currency, Price
                    - Date Purchased
                    - Supplier 
                    - Notes
                    * Motherboard Subasset
                      - RAM 
                      - Hard Drive Size
                    * eth0 Subasset
                      - MAC address
                    * eth1 Subasset
                      - MAC address

Asset Events are used to track the history of an asset, there are 9 asset 
events defined at this point
- Imported
    The asset was imported into the DB (previously existed elsewhere)
- Location Changed
    The location of the asset was updated (discussed below)
- Attached to Asset
    The asset was attached to another asset (discussed below)
- Created
    The asset was added to the DB (did not previously exist)
- Removed from Stock
    Indicates that the asset has been disposed of
- Details Updated
    Indicates that the primary asset details have been updated
- Property Updated
    Indicates that a property of a subasset has been updated
- Subasset Added
    Indicates that an optional subasset was added to the asset
- Subasset Removed
    Indicates that an optional subasset was removed from the asset

Asset Location
--------------

The configuration system allows asset location to be assigned in one of two
ways. An asset may be marked as being at place or as being attached to another
asset. Attached assets derive their location from that of their parent asset. 

Certain sites in the configuration system are marked as "Stock", that is when
an asset is assigned to that site it is regarded as "In Stock" by the system,
all newly created assets are assigned to "In Stock". 

When an asset is selected for use as a host or interface it's location is
automatically updated in the location table. However assets may also be
assigned to a site independently of whether they are used for a host or 
interface.

Asset Functions
---------------

Different assets or subassets may be used for different tasks 
(IE, A soekris can be a host, but not a interface. A wireless card can be an
interface but not a host). When building a list of assets to present to the
user (for example to create a new host) this list of functions is consulted to
determine which assets in the database to populate the list with. 

Asset Use
---------

When populating lists of assets it is common to want to only include "unused",
assets in the list. An asset is unused if it meets the following criteria

- It's current location is at the current site AND
- It is not attached to another asset AND
- It is not being used for it's function already

For example:

    Assets:
    1 - Soekris net4521 - In Stock
    2 - Soekris net4521 - At site 'MWP', not used for anything
    3 - Soekris net4521 - At site 'MWP', used for host 'MWP'
    4 - Wireless card - In Stock
    5 - Wireless card - At site 'MWP', used for interface 'pws' of host MWP
    6 - Wireless card - At site 'PWS', unused
    7 - Wireless card - attached to asset 4

    User requests to add a new host, available asset list contains:
    [1] Soekris net4521

    User requests to add a new host at site MWP, available asset list contains:
    [1] Soekris net4521
    [2] Soekris net4521

    Users selects asset 2 and creates new host MPH at site MWP

    User requests to add a new interface to host MPH, available asset list:
    [4] - Wireless card

    User requests to add a new interface to host PWS as site PWS, list contains:
    [4] - Wireless card
    [6] - Wireless card

To get a list of assets "in stock" the above criteria would simply be used
with the site set to "stock". Note that assets might be at the "stock"
location but be "in use" (if for example they are assigned to a host, but that
host is not assigned to a real site). These assets are marked as in use by the
third criteria above.
