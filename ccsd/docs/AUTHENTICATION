The CRCnet Configuration System uses OpenSSL certificates for mutual
authentication of the client and server. 

The following components are needed

* 1 x Configuration System Certificate Authority
* 1 x Server Key
* n x Client Keys

Some short notes for now

Create your Config System CA
============================

$ openssl req -new -nodes -out ./ccsd-ca-req.pem -keyout ./ccsd-ca-key.pem

You should sign this with your trusted organisation CA (or some other third
party CA) to get your ccsd-ca-cert.pem 

Create the server key and sign with the Config System CA
========================================================

$ openssl req -new -nodes -out ./ccsd-server-req.pem \
    -keyout ./ccsd-server-key.pem

The ou field must be identical to your config system CA certificate
The cn field must be "server" (no quotes)
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NZ
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:.
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Hamilton
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:CRCnet
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:ccsd
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:server
Email Address []:admins@crc.net.nz

$ openssl x509 -req -in ccsd-server-req.pem -out ccsd-server-cert.pem \
    -signkey ccsd-server-key.pem -CA ccsd-ca-cert.pem \
    -CAkey ccsd-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -days 365

Create a client key and sign with the Config System CA
======================================================

This step can be performed multiple times for multiple clients

It is suggested that you use the clients hostname as the cn. The placeholder
<clientname> is used in the example below.
The ou must be identical to the CA certificate

$ openssl req -new -nodes -out ./ccsd-<clientname>-req.pem \
    -keyout ./ccsd-<clientname>-key.pem

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NZ
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:.
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Hamilton
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:CRCnet
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:ccsd
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:<clientname>
Email Address []:<your_email>

$ openssl x509 -req -in ccsd-<clientname>-req.pem \
    -out ccsd-<clientname>-cert.pem \
    -signkey ccsd-<clientname>-key.pem -CA ccsd-ca-cert.pem \
    -CAkey ccsd-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -days 365
